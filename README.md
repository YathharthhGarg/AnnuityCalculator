# Annuities Calculator – [MS Excel + VBA]

We were given ‘interest rate tables’ along with ‘Policyholder data’.

## PART 1
We created a premium calculator, in which a policy holder details are entered manually.

And then by considering probabilities of various factors, the overall probability of enacting the life insurance is calculated.

Using this probability along with other expenses, profit, and errors for each year we calculate the present value of the life policy. An ultimately the total premium to be paid by this policy holder.

## PART 2
Now keeping in mind that we are calculating total premium of a single policy holder using multiple interest rates ‘2%’, ‘4%’, ‘6%’, and ‘8%’.

To manually enter the inputs for each of the policyholder would take a long time, so we automate the process using VBA.

## VBA Code for automating the calculation process

## Using this code, we create a button and get the following total premiums by interest rates within the Policy holder sheet.

## VBA Code for Clear Premiums:

And in this way, we get our automate Annuity calculator.

Let’s connect!
